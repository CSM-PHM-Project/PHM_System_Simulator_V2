## SPEARS Simulator
### Simulated Physics and Environment for Autonomous Risk Studies

SPEARS is a simulation program developed by the Van Bossuyt Research Lab at the
Colorado School of Mines.  

SPEARS is intended to be used to research and develop autonomous behavoir routines
across a range of platforms and environments while being lightweight and easy to 
use.  Visit us on Github at github.com/Van-bossuyt-Research-Lab/SPEARS_Simulator
to check out our wiki for more information on using and developing SPEARS.
