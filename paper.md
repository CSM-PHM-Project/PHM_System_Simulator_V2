  # Summary

  Simulated Physics and Environment for Autonomous Risk Studies (SPEARS) is a Java 
  (Oracle 2017) based simulator for the study of autonomous risk informed decision 
  making in hazardous environments. The published version of SPEARS contains a 
  simulator for a planetary rover that operates in a Martian analog environment 
  generated using plasma fractals, and a micro-submarine that operates in a generated 
  aquatic environment. Simulations can be initiated through a GUI that can be used to 
  generate environments e.g., topography, hazards, and target points, and monitor 
  progress visually, or by using a command line allowing for large batches of 
  behavioral tests to be run. Previous versions of the SPEARS simulator have been 
  used in various publications focusing on the development and evaluation of 
  autonomous decision making under risk (Short 2015), (Mimlitz 2016), (Short 2016).
