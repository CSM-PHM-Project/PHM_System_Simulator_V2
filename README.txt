This code is the second version of the system simulator being used by the
Prognostics and Health Management Research Group and Colorado School of 
Mines to study analog rover-satellite platforms.

Changes in this version will include the implentation of more rigorus
variable tracking procedures to improve accelerated time stepping and the
ability to place swarms of both rovers and satellites into the enviroment.
